# Arduino-Programme

The Arduino programming language is a simplified subset of the C++ programming language. It is designed to be easy to learn and use, even for people with no prior programming experience. The Arduino IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is a free software application that makes it easy to write, compile, and upload Arduino programs to your Arduino board.

The Arduino programming language is divided into three main parts:

Functions: Functions are blocks of code that perform a specific task. They can be called from other parts of your program to perform the same task repeatedly.
Values: Values are variables that can store data, such as numbers, strings, and boolean values.
Structure: The structure of your program is determined by the way you arrange your functions and values.
Here is a simple example of an Arduino program:
